# MangroveCoin 🌱

MangroveCoin is a Base-powered climate rewards protocol that incentivizes verified environmental actions through onchain token minting.

## 🌍 Problem
Community-led climate actions lack transparent, verifiable, and scalable incentive systems.

## 💡 Solution
MangroveCoin enables:
- Offchain verification of environmental activities
- Onchain approval and token minting
- Transparent tracking of impact and rewards

## What it does
- Mints ERC-20 tokens for verified climate actions
- Uses role-based access (Admin / Verifier)
- Prevents proof reuse
- Designed for low-cost micro-rewards on Base

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User submits an environmental activity
2. Admin verifies and approves the activity
3. Smart contract mints MANG tokens to the user wallet
4. Tokens can be exchanged into microcredits
